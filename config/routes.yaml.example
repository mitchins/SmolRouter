# SmolRouter Configuration File
# This file defines routing rules to intelligently direct requests
# to different upstream servers based on source host and model.

routes:
  # Route fast/lightweight models to GPU server
  - match:
      model: "/.*-1.5b/"  # Any model ending in -1.5b (regex)
    route:
      upstream: "http://gpu-server:8000"
      # model: "custom-model"  # Optional: override model name
  
  # Route specific host to dedicated server
  - match:
      source_host: "10.0.1.100"  # Development machine
    route:
      upstream: "http://dev-server:8000"
  
  # Route large models to high-memory server
  - match:
      model: "/.*-70b|.*-405b/"  # Large models (regex)
    route:
      upstream: "http://bigmem-server:8000"
  
  # Route specific models with model override
  - match:
      model: "gpt-4"
    route:
      upstream: "http://claude-server:8000"
      model: "claude-3-opus"  # Override model name
  
  # Catch-all for coding models
  - match:
      model: "/code.*/"  # Any model starting with "code"
    route:
      upstream: "http://code-server:8000"

# Notes:
# - Routes are evaluated in order - first match wins
# - If no route matches, DEFAULT_ROUTE environment variable is used
# - source_host matches the client IP address
# - model patterns support exact match or regex (surrounded by /)
# - Both match criteria are optional - you can match on either or both
# - model override in route is optional - if not specified, original model is preserved
