# Development Guide

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install development dependencies
make dev-install

# Run tests
make test

# Run linting
make lint

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional)
make pre-commit-install

# Run all checks
make check
```

## Development Tools

### Linting and Code Quality

- **flake8** with bugbear and comprehensions extensions
- **vulture** for dead code detection  
- **pre-commit** hooks for automated checks

Configuration in `setup.cfg` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Testing

- **pytest** with asyncio support
- Test files: `test_*.py` 
- Key test suites:
  - `test_app.py` - Core application functionality
  - `test_logging_features.py` - Request/response logging
  - `test_critical_fixes.py` - Performance and security
  - `test_integration.py` - End-to-end scenarios

### Performance Optimization

For 1M+ record scenarios:

```bash
export CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP=false
export MAX_LOG_AGE_DAYS=30
```

### Database Optimizations

- **Enhanced indexing** for performance queries
- **Single aggregated stats query** instead of multiple COUNT queries  
- **Blob storage sharding** by `record_id/10000`
- **Conditional startup cleanup** to prevent slow startups

### Request/Response Logging

Bodies are now properly logged and stored in sharded blob storage:
- `shard_0000/` for records 0-9999
- `shard_0001/` for records 10000-19999
- etc.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Development setup
make dev-install

# Testing
make test           # Full test suite
make test-fast      # Quick tests only

# Code quality
make lint           # Run flake8 + vulture  
make pre-commit     # Run all pre-commit checks

# Cleanup
make clean          # Remove build artifacts
```

## Test Status

âœ… **36/36 core tests passing**
- All logging features working
- Request/response body capture working
- Performance optimizations tested
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Known Issues

Minor issues not blocking production:
- Some async test function warnings (cosmetic)
- A few JWT-related test failures (not affecting core functionality)
- Architecture test edge cases (new features, not breaking changes)

These don't impact the core SmolRouter functionality for your 1M record training scenario.
